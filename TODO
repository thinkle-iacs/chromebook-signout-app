Add "Look Up Asset" tab to get machine history
Add "Look Up Student" tab to get student history
Add "Full History" to get full asset history
Add analogous process for staff:
  - Add Staff field to SignoutHistory in AirTable
  - Add Automation in AirTable to update Inventory based on staff entries
  - Add staff lookup/autocomplete in Checkout.svelte

Maybe add "Batch Sign In" ?

Plans moving forward...
Goals:
-> Email to families who are keeping a machine over the summer
-> Email to students with a second or third machine
-> Email to parents to confirm chromebook contract has been signed

Next steps:
-> Send test email from AirTable
-> Pull parent contact info into AirTable and automate process so updates come in smoothly
-> Pull Chromebook contract form data into AirTable and automate process so updates come in smoothy
-> Build UI for mapping contract data to students and sending contacts confirmation email

Plan:
-> Basically we'll want a table with...
   -> Message Key
   -> Student ID
   -> Email sent?
   Which then triggers an air table message with...
   Message...
   Student...
   CC: Student contacts...

Then we just need our app to write records to that table and AirTable should do the rest "magically"
