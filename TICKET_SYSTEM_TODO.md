# Ticket & Billing System Implementation

**Goal:** Implement a comprehensive ticket and billing system to replace the current Google spreadsheet workflow and enable better tracking of repairs, loans, and invoicing.

## 📚 Project Documentation

This project has been broken down into manageable, focused documents:

- **[📋 Project Overview](./docs/ticket-system/README.md)** - High-level goals, problems, and development phases
- **[👥 User Stories](./docs/ticket-system/STORIES.md)** - Detailed workflows for all user personas (Students, Librarians, Techs, IT Director)
- **[🗄️ Database Schema](./docs/ticket-system/SCHEMA.md)** - Complete AirTable table designs, fields, relationships, and automations
- **[✅ Implementation TODO](./docs/ticket-system/TODO.md)** - Phase-by-phase development tasks with priorities

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start Here**: Read the [Project Overview](./docs/ticket-system/README.md) for context
2. **Understand Workflows**: Review [User Stories](./docs/ticket-system/STORIES.md) to see complete user journeys
3. **Set Up Data**: Follow [Database Schema](./docs/ticket-system/SCHEMA.md) to configure AirTable
4. **Begin Development**: Use [Implementation TODO](./docs/ticket-system/TODO.md) for step-by-step tasks

## ⚡ Current Status: Phase 1 - TicketEditor Interface

**✅ COMPLETED:**

- ✅ Basic TicketEditor component with centralized update logic
- ✅ Editable text fields for User Description, Public Notes, Private Notes
- ✅ Student and Device assignment with dropdown search functionality
- ✅ History tracking for all field changes with human-readable entries
- ✅ Status dropdowns for Ticket Status, Device Status, Temp Status
- ✅ Custom EditableTextField component with save/revert functionality
- ✅ Modular TicketStudentAssignment and TicketAssetAssignment components

**🚧 IN PROGRESS - TicketEditor Improvements:**

### Priority 1: Device Status Integration

- [ ] Connect Device Status changes to actual inventory records
- [ ] Update asset status in inventory when device status changes on ticket
- [ ] Implement status validation (e.g., "Repairing" → set device to unavailable)
- [ ] Sync device status between ticket system and checkout system

### Priority 2: Status Workflow Logic

- [ ] Define and implement ticket lifecycle workflows
- [ ] Add validation for status transitions (e.g., can't close without resolution)
- [ ] Auto-update related fields when status changes
- [ ] Add status-based UI hints and required fields
- [ ] Implement business rules for status changes

### Priority 3: Temporary Device Assignment

- [ ] Add temporary device selection component to TicketEditor
- [ ] Implement temp device checkout workflow from ticket interface
- [ ] Connect temp device status to main checkout system
- [ ] Auto-update student's current loans when temp device assigned
- [ ] Track temp device return requirements

### Priority 4: Device Check-in for Repair

- [ ] Add "Check in for Repair" action to TicketEditor
- [ ] Update device status in inventory when checked in
- [ ] Create repair tracking workflow
- [ ] Link repair tickets to original issue tickets
- [ ] Integrate with existing Checkout.svelte repair workflow

**🔄 NEXT PHASES:**

## Phase 2: Workflow Integration

- Integration with existing Checkout.svelte for repair workflows
- Temporary device management from ticket interface
- Status synchronization between systems

## Phase 3: Billing Integration

- Invoice generation from ticket data
- Family contact integration
- Payment tracking

## Phase 4: Advanced Workflows

- Automated notifications
- Reporting dashboard
- Mobile optimization

## 🎯 Key Problems Being Solved

1. **✅ Inventory/Ticket Disconnect** - TicketEditor now links tickets to inventory data with editable assignments
2. **🚧 Device Status Tracking** - Working on real-time device status updates and workflow integration
3. **🔄 Repair Workflow** - Next: streamlined repair check-in process integrated with existing checkout system
4. **🔄 Billing Integration** - Future: automated invoice generation

## 📝 Architecture Notes

- **Modular Components**: TicketEditor uses composable subcomponents (EditableTextField, TicketStudentAssignment, TicketAssetAssignment)
- **Centralized Updates**: All ticket updates go through `doTicketUpdate()` for consistent history tracking
- **Store Integration**: Leverages existing student and asset stores for dropdown functionality
- **Human-Readable History**: All changes tracked with user-friendly descriptions showing names/emails instead of IDs

_The TicketEditor provides a solid foundation for comprehensive ticket management. Current focus is on integrating with existing workflows and completing device status synchronization._
